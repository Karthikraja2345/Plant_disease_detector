Smart Leaf Disease Detector (OpenCV Project)
A real-time crop disease detection system built with OpenCV and a pre-trained Hugging Face MobileNetV2 model. Identify 38+ plant disease classes or healthy leaves from live webcam feed or static images, with voice feedback and saved results.

Features
Core OpenCV Processing: Captures and preprocesses frames/images using OpenCV for leaf gating and annotation

Hugging Face Model: Uses linkanjarad/mobilenet_v2_1.0_224-plant-disease-identification for 38+ classes at ~95.4% accuracy

Live Webcam & Image Modes: Press SPACE to analyze live feed or provide an image file

Leaf Gating: Ensures only frames with ≥20% green leaf coverage are analyzed

Top 3 Predictions: Displays and announces the top 3 disease or healthy labels with confidence scores

Voice Feedback: Announces detection results via text-to-speech

Result Saving: Annotated detection images saved to detections/ with timestamp

Pure OpenCV Integration: All image capture, masking, and drawing use OpenCV functions

Installation
Clone the repository or copy the code files.

Install dependencies:

bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pillow transformers torch torchvision pyttsx3
Usage
Run the script:

bash
python smart_leaf_detector.py
Choose mode when prompted:

1 – Live Webcam

2 – Image File

Webcam Mode:

Press SPACE to capture and analyze the frame.

Voice and console output announce the top disease prediction.

Annotated result displays and saves to detections/.

Press q to quit.

Image File Mode:

Enter the path to a leaf image file.

Analysis runs once, voice and console output announce the result.

Annotated image saves to detections/.

Press any key to close the window.

Customization
Change Model
The script uses the MobileNetV2 plant disease model by default. To use a different Hugging Face model, update in the constructor:

python
self.classifier = pipeline(
    "image-classification",
    model="linkanjarad/mobilenet_v2_1.0_224-plant-disease-identification"
)
Leaf Coverage Threshold
Adjust self.min_leaf_coverage to change the required green coverage (default 0.20).

Voice Rate
Modify self.tts.setProperty('rate', 150) for different speech speed.
